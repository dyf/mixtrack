Trying to build a model that can extract vocals from a mix. 

### Data
The [The 'Mixing Secrets' Free Multitrack Download Library](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) is great, but uncurated.  [![MUSDB18](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1117372.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1117372) should work just fine.
